# Food-Aid
Created the Food-Aid project as part of the hackathon in Zero Hunder category. It has a webpage that shows various facts about food waste. I created a donation application, where we can post the food available in our fridge to be donated, its details and its photos. A user can check for food available in nearby houses available for donation and connect with the donating house. Based on the dataset of wasted food, we found the important factors that lead to wastage, performed Exploratory data analysis and showed various graphs.
